*Note that I did not have the figma/sketch file to get exact pixels, colors or styles. I did make deviations from the style-guide.md when they did not match the final design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Learned about the form element, general validation and using parentElement in JS. 


### Useful resources

- [Javascript form validation](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form-validation/) - I googled this article to get me started on learning the JS for the form validation. 
- [Video by WEB CIFAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD4qiSU1CBQ) - When I was having issues with my frist attempt, I looked at the JS in this example.
- [stackoverflow help](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11701844/html-5-browsers-pop-up-on-input-with-type-email) - I was having an isue with an auto alert that is in the broswer with input="email". This post helped me find how to remove that.
